# Joystick Controlled Robot

## Description

This project is aimed at creating a robot that can be controlled using a joystick. The joystick provides intuitive and precise control over the movement of the robot, allowing users to navigate it through various environments with ease.

The project utilizes hardware components such as a microcontroller, motor drivers, motors, and a joystick module. Additionally, it involves software development for both the microcontroller firmware and a user interface for controlling the robot.

## Features

- **Joystick Control**: The robot's movement is controlled using a joystick, offering intuitive and precise control.
- **Multi-Directional Movement**: The robot can move in multiple directions including forward, backward, left, and right.
- **Speed Control**: Ability to adjust the speed of the robot's movement for different applications or environments.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface for controlling the robot, possibly implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer or mobile device.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporation of feedback mechanisms to provide users with information about the robot's status or environment.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Motor drivers
- Motors (DC motors, stepper motors, etc.)
- Joystick module
- Power source (batteries, power supply)

## Software Requirements

- Firmware development environment (Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi Python development)
- Motor control libraries (e.g., Adafruit Motor Shield library for Arduino)
- User interface development tools (e.g., Python with Tkinter for desktop GUI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web-based interface)

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect the joystick module to the microcontroller.
2. Connect the motor drivers to the microcontroller and motors.
3. Write and upload the firmware code to the microcontroller, ensuring proper initialization of the joystick module and motor drivers.
4. Develop the user interface for controlling the robot, ensuring compatibility with the chosen hardware platform.
5. Connect the user interface to the microcontroller via a suitable communication protocol (e.g., serial communication, Wi-Fi).
6. Test the robot's movement and control using the joystick and user interface.
7. Fine-tune the control parameters and interface based on testing feedback.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot and ensure that the joystick and microcontroller are properly connected.
2. Launch the user interface on the control device (computer, smartphone, etc.).
3. Use the joystick to control the robot's movement, adjusting speed and direction as needed.
4. Monitor the robot's feedback, if implemented, to ensure safe and efficient operation.
5. Power off the robot after use and store it in a safe location.
